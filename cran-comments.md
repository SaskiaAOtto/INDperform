  We removed/deactivated the visual tests (code in test files as comment currently included, reference plots removed) as we were requested by Hadley Wickham to fix to failed visual test with the new ggplot v2.3.0 release (which is not on CRAN yet so the reference plots and generated test plots did not match). Consequently we also removed 'vdiffr' removed from import list namespace, which also fixed the NOTE raised above.
